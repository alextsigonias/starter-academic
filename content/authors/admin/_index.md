I am a fourth-year PhD student at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/), advised by Prof. [Andreas S. Schulz](https://www.or.tum.de/en/group/andreas-s-schulz/) and co-advised by Prof. [Martin Bichler](https://dss.in.tum.de/staff/bichler.html). I am a member of the [Operations Research Group](https://www.or.tum.de/en/home/) and the interdisciplinary research group [Advanced Optimization in a Networked Economy (AdONE)](https://www.gs.tum.de/en/adone/start/). Before that, I received my Diploma from the National Technical University of Athens, where I was advised by Prof. [Dimitris Fotakis](https://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/). In Fall 2019 I visited the Universidad de Chile in Santiago, where I was hosted by Prof. [Jos√© Correa](https://www.dii.uchile.cl/~jcorrea/).



My research interests broadly lie at the intersection of Economics and Computation. My recent work has focused in (algorithmic) mechanism design and online algorithms. I am also interested in market design and various aspects of optimization and sequential decision-making.
