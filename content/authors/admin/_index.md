I am currently a PhD trainee at the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html). Until very recently, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Department of Industrial Engineering](https://www.dii.uchile.cl/english/) of the University of Chile hosted by Prof. [Jos√© Correa](https://www.dii.uchile.cl/~jcorrea/). I was a member of the [Information and Computation in Market Design (ICMD)](https://sites.google.com/view/anilloicmd/home?authuser=0) team. I obtained my PhD from the [School of Computation, Information and Technology](https://www.cit.tum.de/en/cit/home/) of the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/). At TUM, I was advised by Prof. [Andreas S. Schulz](https://www.ot.mgt.tum.de/en/or/group/andreas-s-schulz/) and was a member of the interdisciplinary research group [Advanced Optimization in a Networked Economy (AdONE)](https://www.gs.tum.de/en/adone/start/) and the [Operations Research Group](https://www.ot.mgt.tum.de/en/or/home/). Before that, I received my Diploma from the National Technical University of Athens, where I was advised by Prof. [Dimitris Fotakis](https://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/). During my PhD and postdoc, I had the opportunity to spend some time at [Google Zurich](https://research.google/locations/zurich/) and the [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en).


 My main research topic recently has been on the design of algorithms and mechanisms for fair and efficient resource allocation with applications in pricing, recommender systems, apportionment, and generally complex scenarios arising in (online) markets and platforms. I have a background and extensive training in both Computer Science and Operations Research. In my research, I have used a broad set of tools from algorithms, economics, operations, mechanism design, machine learning, and optimization. I enjoy developing algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees and demonstrating their applicability via experimentation on real-world data whenever possible. Apart from my research expertise, I have a strong interest in adjacent fields such as econometrics and causal inference. I love broadening my knowledge and exploring new topics and I aspire to work on projects, new technologies, and products with societal impact.
